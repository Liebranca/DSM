# dsm: the evil framework

So what's in this repo?

* `Zajec` general-purpose utility lib.
* `Chasm` window/input manager.
* `SIN` retrophile graphics.
* `Gaoler` block-based c++ physics.
* `BlackMagic` model/scene converter (Blender 2.79 only).
* `DarkAge` game logic/game engine.

There's a couple dependencies: SDL2, glew & glm. You can get 'em from this here MEGA link:

And what's special about this motor? It's user-hostile and will spit you right in the eye if you don't know C. That's the point -- no GUIs, no buttons, no nuthin': just text.

Thus far, still a WIP. Don't get your hopes up.
