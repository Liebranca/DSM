# DSM: the evil framework

THUS FAR, STILL A WIP

We have the following modules in development or planned so far:

* `Zajec` general-purpose utility lib.
* `Chasm` window manager powered by SDL2.
* `SIN` retrophile OpenGL renderer.
* `Gaoler` no-nonsense block-based c++ physics.
* `BlackMagic` file import/export.
* `Inquisitor` modding toolset.
* `DarkAge` oldschool game logic for hardcore design.

The aim of the project is creating a game development kit for personal use.
